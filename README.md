# Tickler
Tickler is a social media app for sharing photos that I created for a class project. It borrows features from other social media sites such as facebook, twitter, and instagram.

The app allows you to upload photos, tickle your friends, message friends, and comment on photos. You also have a profile that you can update. In order to message a user, upload a photo, change your bio, or anything that involves entering something into the database requires the user to be active so anyone can sign up and tickle people but only active users can enter stuff into the database. I did this to prevent random people from just entering stuff into the database. As of current the only way to become active is for an admin to go into the database and change a user's status to active.

Other features I intended to include one day and may still include being able to rate a photo.

For styles I used Semantic UI as I had never used it before and wanted to explore it as well as it had some really cool looking features.
